# PWJ Devs Got Talent: Social Media Dashboard

## Summary
This is the first project I had done for Devs got talent. As a beginner, I feel that I was able to participate well in this challenge.
I learned a great deal about how to work with html and CSS for this project. The BEM file structure was also used for this project.
I used pure html and CSS with no special libraries. Some SVG files were used for my icons and also a web font from Google fonts.   
### These are some of the elements which were used:
* Media queries
* Web fonts
* Flexbox
* SVG icons
 
## Layout and organization
All the sections are contained in their own blocks and some of the content is arranged within each block using flexbox properties.


## File Management
Each block has a folder with a respective CSS file which contains the styles which are applied to that block. All stylesheets are imported  
into the index.css file. This helps to keep the stylesheet organized and also helps the html page to load faster.  

## Improvements and modifications
I have really learned a lot with this project. I have a better understanding of how media queries work and also about how to arrange items with flexbox.
